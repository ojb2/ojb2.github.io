<center> People with poor fine motor control often have problems using touchscreen devices becuase of the precision required to touch the pad of your finger to the correct spot with little to no tactile feedback. Even stretching out a single finger to the screen can be an impossibility, let alone aiming at and making contact with the correct spot on the smooth screen. This was a consistent problem with one of the children I watched this summer. She's too young to be able to type out what she'd like to say using a keyboard, but the talking devices available to her all operated as apps on a tablet.  </center>

<center>The layout of the apps that currently exist seem to work well for young children who have difficulties speaking. The problem is with the devices they operate on. The current software uses a combination of colour coding, simple graphics, and written words to help users navigate the different words and phrases programmed into them. They also conjugate the verbs in a way that makes sentence fragments more understandable for those trying to communicate with the users. The buttons can be a little small, but a different device might negate the use for buttons altogether. </center>
