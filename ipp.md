<center>Over the summer, I cared for a young girl with cerebral palsy that made speech difficult. She's too young to be able to type out what she'd like to say using a keyboard, but the talking devices available to her all operated as apps on a tablet.</center>

<center>The layout of the apps that currently exist seem to work well, and conversations I had with her speech therapist gave me some insights into why they are laid out the way they are, and which layouts tend to be the most effective with young children and other people who canâ€™t read. The current software uses a combination of colour coding, simple graphics, and written words to help users navigate the different words and phrases programmed into them. They also conjugate the verbs in a way that makes sentence fragments more understandable for those trying to communicate with the users. The problem is with the devices these apps operate on.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
People with poor fine motor control often have problems using touchscreen devices because of the precision required to touch the pad of your finger to the correct spot with little to no tactile feedback. This was a consistent problem over the summer. Even pressing play on a paused Netflix show can be a frustrating ordeal. While Windows has released an eye-controlled tablet, the technology is still new and relatively inaccessible.  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
For this reason, I propose a device that provides the same services as a talker app, but runs on a device that makes use of more tactile controls such as buttons and switches. With controls modeled after those used by her wheelchair. While there is a screen with visual components, the main control is an easily accessed joystick, rotatable depending on the grip the user can most easily accomplish. There are also a few large raised buttons and a wheel that can be turned to control speed.</center>
