## This lightswitch is awesome.
My pictures still aren't uploading so I guess I'll try again in the morning?

The green light indicates that the motion sensors are activated and the light will turn on if it detects movement.
The arrows indicate the brightness of the lights and will light up when touched to indicate that they are working.
The buttons are all clearly labeled without looking gaudy or overdone and the whole thing blends nicely with the wall.
