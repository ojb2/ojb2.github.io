## This window took me a few days to figure out how to open. That's too amny days.

When the handles on the side are down, the window is locked.
HOWEVER, when I attempted to push them up, I could only get halfway before I encountered resistance.
Not wanting to break my brand new window, I didn't push further.
Turns out they need to be all the way up to unlock the window, which is scary becuase I don't want to have to replace this window.
Only after that has been done on both sides can the handle in the center be pried out and rotated, opening the window.
